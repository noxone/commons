# nox-commons

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/noxone/commons.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/noxone/commons)

## What is it

The ``nox-commons`` is just a bunch of useful methods. The methods offered here are not restricted to a specific subject area, but rather represent a collection of methods that are used from time to time, but are too complex to "just" write.

Use it as you like to perform common tasks. Ideas for new methods are very welcome.

## Sub projects

All methods are assigned to specific subject areas. There is a subproject for each area. Currently there are:

- ``commons-io``: A collection of IO related methods.
- ``commons-fx``: A bunch of classes containing useful methods for JavaFX.
